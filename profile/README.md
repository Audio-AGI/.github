Audio-AGI is an open-source research community. The community members are working on audio x AI research, including but not limited to:
- Computational auditory scene analysis (e.g., source separation, audio classification, acoustic event detection)
- Generative AI for audio (e.g., text-to-audio/music/speech synthesis, audio super-resolution)
- Large language models (LLMs) for audio/speech/music signals
