Audio-AGI is an open-source research community. The community members are working on audio x AI research, including but not limited to:
- Computational auditory scene analysis (e.g., source separation, audio classification, acoustic event detection)
- Generative AI for audio (e.g., text-to-audio/music/speech synthesis, audio super-resolution)
- Large language models (LLMs) for audio/speech/music signals

Our community members come from diverse research academic and industrial institutes such as the University of Surrey, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Imperial College London, Queen Mary University of London, Xian Jiaotong Liverpool University and Reka AI.
